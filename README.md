I've worked a lot around music: 
I've been a music journalist.
I've been a venue producer and programmer.
I've been a host, curator, creator, and organizer of parties, music and poetry festivals, music concerts, tours, and strategic press and promotion plans.

I also did a lot around language:
I have founded a poetry publishing house.
I taught Spanish and English as a way of living.
I've published and printed poetry books and fanzines.
I co-founded a poetry publishing house as part of a collective.

I also write code. I work as a "Full Stack Web Developer". 
I've worked with JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Python.
I love to learn, to change. I don't get bored.
