# Hi, I'm Juan

### Full Stack AI Engineer

A Full Stack Web Developer with over 6 years of experience, I specialize in building robust, scalable solutions using JavaScript, Typescript, PHP, Node.js, and Python, alongside modern frameworks like React and Vue. My background in journalism and education provides a unique, user-centric perspective that enriches my technical work, allowing me to bridge the gap between complex technology and meaningful human experiences.  Recently, I've focused on the transformative potential of AI in software development. I am passionate about exploring and implementing Agentic AI to enhance productivity and foster innovation. As a key advocate for tools like GitHub Copilot, I've had the opportunity to mentor colleagues and lead initiatives that drive efficiency—such as spearheading a migration to Vite that significantly improved our team's build and deployment times.  I am a collaborative, proactive problem-solver, driven by the belief that technology and art can create powerful new ways for us to connect. I am committed to continuous learning and leveraging cutting-edge tools to build the next generation of digital solutions.
